# SiteGUI Templates
This contains default templates shipped with SiteGUI. Use them as the base to customize your own templates.

SiteGUI Templates should also work for LiteGUI as they have all LiteGUI template files besides other template files for cloud-only apps. If you develop templates for both SiteGUI and LiteGUI, you should start with SiteGUI template.
